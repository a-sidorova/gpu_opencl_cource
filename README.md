This repository stores laboratory works of Programming on new Architecture-1 (GPU) course of autumn 2021.

*Language*: C/C++

*Tools*: OpenCL

### Structure
1. 00_utils - *Static library: Common utilities for all labs: creattion kernels from .cl files, getting platfroms and devices, checks for correct calculations, etc.*
2. 01_hello_world - *First lab: Print thread info and addition of src data and global ID of thread.*
3. 02_axpy - *Second lab: Create function analogues of `axpy` function from BLASS library: `saxpy` for float and `daxpy` for double.*
4. 03_gemm - *Third lab: Matrix Blocked Multiplication (GEMM)*
5. 04_jacobi - *Fourth lab: the Jacobi method is an iterative algorithm for determining the solutions of a strictly diagonally dominant system of linear equations.*
